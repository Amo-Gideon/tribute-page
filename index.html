Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email I've ever written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. Missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.</p>
